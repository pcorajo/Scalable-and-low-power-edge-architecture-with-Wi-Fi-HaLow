# Scalable-and-low-power-edge-architecture-with-Wi-Fi-HaLow
Urban biodiversity monitoring in smart cities requires scalable and efficient computing architectures capable of handling real-time, distributed sensing tasks. This paper proposes a low-power edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) framework that enables on-device acoustic detection and classification of bird species,.
